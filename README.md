# Analyzing Presidential Debates Using NLP

During each Presidential election in the US, three Presidential debates are held in which the main candidates of the Republican & Democratic parties engage in debates. We analyzed the debates for 5 Presidential Elections, starting from 2000 up to 2016, so we have data
for 15 debates. These debate transcripts were available on the American Presidency Project hosted at the University of California - Santa Barbara's website.

The topics discussed are often controversial, so we thought that we might stumble upon some interesting insights by using some Natural Language Processing algorithms.
